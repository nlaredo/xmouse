Provide the one UI feature that Apple left out...

# WARNING #
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.  IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USABLE AS IT STANDS.  **DO NOT USE XMOUSE UNTIL THIS WARNING IS REMOVED OR UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISKS AND WANT TO CONTRIBUTE CODE.**

# Further Info #
The current state of the code is just a check-in of experiments gone bad.

Generating clicks in windows automatically to activate was not the goal of this, but just an early experiment that taught the lesson that every icon on the dock is also a window and rolling the mouse over them will start all applications in the dock.

Future explorations:
have one app that runs first and makes every window a child of it.  ffm should be easy from here once the API is discovered for embedding another app's windows in your own app.
